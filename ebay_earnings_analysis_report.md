## 6. E-Commerce Sector Volatility Comparison

### Beta & Volatility Metrics:
| Stock | Beta | 5Y Monthly | Implied Vol | Risk Level |
|-------|------|------------|-------------|------------|
| **EBAY** | 1.38 | Medium | Medium | MODERATE |
| **AMZN** | 1.38 | Medium | Medium | MODERATE-HIGH |
| **SHOP** | 2.82 | Very High | Very High | HIGH |

### Key Comparisons:
**EBAY vs AMZN:**
- Similar beta (1.38) but AMZN has higher absolute volatility due to AWS exposure
- eBay is pure-play marketplace (simpler business model)
- AMZN moves 8-15% on earnings; eBay typically moves 5-8%

**EBAY vs SHOP:**
- SHOP beta is 2.03x higher (2.82 vs 1.38)
- SHOP recently dropped 13% on earnings miss
- eBay's mature business = more predictable results

**Sector Stability Verdict:** eBay is among the MORE STABLE e-commerce plays, significantly less volatile than Shopify and slightly less volatile than Amazon on a relative basis.

## 7. Dividend Consideration for Put Selling

### Dividend Metrics:
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Forward Dividend | $1.16/share |
| Dividend Yield | 1.46% |
| Payout Ratio | ~25% (conservative) |
| Dividend Growth | 7.55% (FY24) |
| Consecutive Increases | 5+ years |
| Ex-Dividend Date | Nov 28, 2025 (quarterly) |

### Assignment Consideration:
**PROS:**
- ✅ 1.46% yield provides income cushion if assigned
- ✅ Low payout ratio (~25%) = sustainable dividend
- ✅ Consistent annual increases since 2019
- ✅ Strong cash flow ($1.5B+ FCF) supports dividend

**CONS:**
- ⚠️ Modest yield vs dividend-focused stocks (2-4% typical)
- ⚠️ Quarterly distribution means limited timing arbitrage

**Assignment Acceptability:** **7/10**
The dividend makes assignment palatable but not compelling. At current prices, assigned shares would yield ~1.4% annually - better than cash but not exceptional.

## 8. Overall Assessment: "Boring But Safe" Put Selling Candidate?

### STABILITY SCORE: **8/10**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Earnings Predictability | 8.5/10 | Consistent beats, mature business |
| Move Respect | 8/10 | Usually stays within EM bounds |
| Volatility (vs peers) | 8/10 | Less volatile than SHOP/AMZN |
| Balance Sheet | 9/10 | $3.4B cash, manageable debt |
| Dividend Safety | 8/10 | Conservative payout, growing |
| Technical Setup | 7/10 | Pulled back, approaching support |

### Put Selling Strategy Recommendation:

**RECOMMENDED STRIKE ZONES:**
- **Conservative (90% POP):** $65-70 puts (~15-20% OTM)
- **Moderate (75% POP):** $72-75 puts (~10-12% OTM)
- **Aggressive (60% POP):** $78-80 puts (~3-5% OTM)

**RECOMMENDED EXPIRATION:**
- 7-14 DTE (through earnings)
- 30-45 DTE (post-earnings capture)

**RISK FACTORS TO MONITOR:**
1. French regulatory actions (ongoing investigation)
2. Holiday quarter guidance (biggest near-term risk)
3. Consumer spending trends
4. Competitive dynamics (Temu, Shein)

### FINAL VERDICT:
**YES - eBay is an excellent "boring but safe" put selling candidate.**

**Why:**
- Predictable quarterly results with limited surprises
- Mature business model with stable cash flows
- Lower volatility than growth-phase e-commerce peers
- Dividend provides modest income cushion if assigned
- Recent pullback offers better entry prices

**Best For:** Conservative put sellers seeking income with lower assignment risk. Not suitable for those seeking high premiums - eBay options trade at lower IV than growth names.

**Capital Efficiency:** Moderate. Better premium-to-risk ratio than SHOP, slightly lower than AMZN.

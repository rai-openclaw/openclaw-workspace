## Detailed Analysis

### PANW - Palo Alto Networks Inc.

---
**Ticker**: PANW  
**Company**: Palo Alto Networks Inc.  
**Expected Move**: 9.04% (from options market pricing - TipRanks/Parameter.io)  
**Risk Level**: Medium-High  
**Market Cap**: $134.9B  
**Earnings Time**: After Market Close (AMC)  
**Quarter**: Q2 FY2026  

**Key Findings**:
- **Earnings Context**: Reporting Q2 FY26 earnings after market close (AMC) - February 17, 2026
- **Analyst Expectations**: EPS $0.94 (adjusted, +16% YoY), Revenue $2.58B (+14% YoY) - Visible Alpha consensus
- **Recent News**: 
  - Announced acquisition of Koi for Agentic Endpoint Security (Feb 2026)
  - Completed $25B CyberArk acquisition
  - Closed Chronosphere acquisition
- **AI Security Threats**: Unit 42 2026 Global Incident Response Report shows AI accelerating attacks 4x over past year, boosting demand for cybersecurity
- **Stock Performance**: Down 9% YTD 2026, down 20% over past year, nearly 25% off October 2024 highs
- **Options Activity**: High options volume expected, with traders pricing in 9.04% move (DOUBLE the 4.55% average move of last 4 quarters)
- **Insider Activity**: Recent insider selling in January 2026 (Klarich Lee sold shares at $192-193)
- **Competitive Landscape**: Facing increased competition from Microsoft and CrowdStrike in cybersecurity space
- **Platform Strategy**: Pushing platformization deals (Strata, Prisma, Cortex) with CyberArk integration key focus
- **Valuation**: Trading at 83x forward earnings despite recent pullback

**Analyst Sentiment**: **Strongly Bullish** (30 Buy, 16 Strong Buy, 13 Hold, 2 Sell per Finnhub Feb 2026 data). Average price target $225.06 (~34.8% upside from $167 close)

**Historical Accuracy**: **Excellent beat history but mixed stock reaction** - Beat earnings estimates in each of past 9 quarters (per Finnhub data):
- Q1 FY26: $0.93 actual vs $0.9081 estimate (+2.41% beat)
- Q4 FY25: $0.95 actual vs $0.9021 estimate (+5.31% beat)  
- Q3 FY25: $0.80 actual vs $0.7855 estimate (+1.85% beat)
- Q2 FY25: $0.81 actual vs $0.7929 estimate (+2.16% beat)

Average move last 4 quarters: 4.55% (current expected move of 9.04% is DOUBLE historical average).

**Red Flags**: 
1. **Double the expected move** (9.04% vs 4.55% historical average) suggests heightened uncertainty/risk
2. Recent EPS miss last quarter (Q1 FY26) - though still beat estimates slightly
3. High valuation at 83x forward earnings despite recent pullback
4. Integration risks from multiple acquisitions (CyberArk $25B, Chronosphere, Koi)
5. Broader software sector selloff pressuring multiples
6. **Fed timing risk**: FOMC Minutes release tomorrow (Feb 18) could create macro volatility
7. Insider selling in January 2026
8. Growth deceleration concerns (14-15% revenue growth guidance vs historical 20%+)

**Recommendation**: **deep dive worth it** - High expected move (9.04%), critical sector positioning with AI security tailwinds, and potential for guidance update on acquisition integration. However, the DOUBLE historical expected move suggests elevated risk - consider defined-risk options strategies.

### CDNS - Cadence Design Systems Inc.

---
**Ticker**: CDNS  
**Company**: Cadence Design Systems Inc.  
**Expected Move**: ~3-4% (estimated based on historical patterns, lower than PANW)  
**Risk Level**: Medium  
**Market Cap**: $81.5B  
**Earnings Time**: After Market Close (AMC)  
**Quarter**: Q4 2025  

**Key Findings**:
- **Earnings Context**: Reporting Q4 2025 earnings after market close (AMC) - February 17, 2026
- **Analyst Expectations**: EPS $1.90-$1.91 (non-GAAP, +1.1-1.6% YoY), Revenue $1.42-1.44B range
- **Sector Position**: Leading EDA (Electronic Design Automation) software provider in duopoly with Synopsys
- **AI/ML Tailwinds**: Benefiting from semiconductor design complexity and AI chip design demand; recently launched Chiplet ecosystem for AI chip development
- **Guidance**: Q4 revenue guidance $1.405B-$1.435B, non-GAAP EPS $1.88-$1.94
- **Peer Performance**: Synopsys (SNPS) reported strong results recently, positive read-through for EDA sector
- **Stock Performance**: Down 2.5% over past month, down 10.47% over past year
- **Valuation**: Trading at ~40x forward earnings (77.3x P/E based on Simply Wall St), premium valuation
- **Recent News**: Stock rose 4.52% after launching new Chiplet ecosystem for AI chip development

**Analyst Sentiment**: **Bullish** (17 Buy, 9 Strong Buy, 6 Hold, 0 Sell per Finnhub Feb 2026 data). Average analyst price target $379.59 vs current ~$299 (26.8% upside potential)

**Historical Accuracy**: **Generally strong** - Company has history of meeting or beating expectations (per Finnhub data):
- Q3 2025: $1.93 actual vs $1.8232 estimate (+5.86% beat)
- Q2 2025: $1.65 actual vs $1.5856 estimate (+4.06% beat)
- Q1 2025: $1.57 actual vs $1.5211 estimate (+3.21% beat)
- Q4 2024: $1.88 actual vs $1.8562 estimate (+1.28% beat)

Stock reaction typically muted for this steady performer (3-4% expected moves).

**Red Flags**:
1. Slower growth rate (low single-digit EPS growth) compared to some software peers
2. Exposure to semiconductor cycle volatility
3. Valuation at premium multiples (40x forward earnings, 77x trailing P/E)
4. **Fed timing risk**: FOMC Minutes tomorrow could impact tech multiples
5. Short interest: 4.39M shares (1.61% of float) - not extreme but worth monitoring

**Recommendation**: **deep dive worth it for conservative traders** - Lower expected move than PANW (estimated 3-4% vs PANW's 9.04%) but more predictable business model and strong competitive position in EDA duopoly. Better for longer-term investors than high-volatility earnings traders.

### MDT - Medtronic PLC

---
**Ticker**: MDT  
**Company**: Medtronic PLC  
**Expected Move**: ~3-4% (typical for large-cap medical devices)  
**Risk Level**: Low-Medium  
**Market Cap**: $127.5B  
**Earnings Time**: Already reported Before Market Open (BMO)  
**Quarter**: Q3 FY26  

**Key Findings**:
- **Earnings Context**: Already reported Q3 FY26 before market open (BMO) - **ACTUAL RESULTS IN**

- **Performance Drivers**: Cardiovascular sales +11%, Diabetes +8.3% - strongest revenue growth in 10 quarters
- **Guidance**: Reaffirmed FY26 outlook, EPS guidance $5.62-$5.66
- **Stock Reaction**: Typically muted post-earnings for large-cap medtech

**Analyst Sentiment**: Neutral to Positive - Execution improving but growth concerns remain

**Historical Accuracy**: Generally stays within expected move range

**Red Flags**:
1. Already reported - opportunity for options trade has passed
2. Lower volatility stock with smaller expected moves
3. Medical device regulatory environment uncertainties

**Recommendation**: **skip** - Already reported with beat, lower expected move makes it less interesting for earnings trading.

### DVN - Devon Energy Corporation

---

**Company**: Devon Energy Corporation  
**Expected Move**: ~6-7% (estimated, energy stocks typically volatile)  
**Risk Level**: Medium-High

**Red Flags**:
1. Commodity price exposure (WTI, natural gas)
2. Capital discipline concerns in volatile energy market
3. Environmental/ESG pressures on fossil fuel companies
4. Market cap below $50B threshold
5. Earnings expected to decline 30% YoY

**Recommendation**: **skip** - While energy stocks can have big moves, commodity price dependence makes it more macro trade than company-specific earnings play. Also below $50B market cap threshold.

### RSG - Republic Services Inc.

---
**Ticker**: RSG  
**Company**: Republic Services Inc.  
**Expected Move**: ~2-3% (estimated, waste management stocks typically low volatility)  
**Risk Level**: Low-Medium

**Earnings Time**: After Market Close (AMC)

- **Historical Accuracy**: **Mixed** - Missed revenue estimates 6 times over last 2 years. Last quarter (Q3 2025) missed revenue by 0.8% ($4.21B actual vs est)
- **Peer Performance**: Waste Connections (WCN) traded down 8.2% after earnings, Waste Management (WM) down 3.7% - negative read-through
- **Valuation**: P/E 33.36, PEG 3.59, Beta 0.54 (low volatility)

**Analyst Sentiment**: **Cautiously Optimistic** - Mostly Buy/Hold ratings with moderate upside

**Historical Accuracy**: Mixed - Company has inconsistent track record of meeting revenue estimates

**Red Flags**:
1. **Peer negative reactions**: WCN down 8.2%, WM down 3.7% post-earnings
2. History of revenue misses (6 times in last 2 years)
3. Slowing revenue growth (4.1% YoY expected vs 5.6% last year)
4. Waste management sector typically has low earnings volatility
5. Low beta stock (0.54) suggests smaller expected moves

**Recommendation**: **skip** - Low expected move (~2-3%), inconsistent revenue history, and negative peer reactions make this less attractive for earnings trading despite meeting market cap criteria.

## Technical Analysis & Trade Grades

### PANW (Palo Alto Networks)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Move** | 9.04% (±$15.10 from $167 close) |
| **Historical Avg Move** | 4.55% (expected is 2X historical) |
| **Put Premium (est.)** | ~$5.50-$7.00 for 30-delta puts 1 week out |
| **IV Rank** | High (elevated due to earnings + acquisitions) |
| **Trade Grade** | **B+** |

**Grade Notes**: High expected move creates opportunity, but 2X historical average signals elevated risk. Best for experienced traders with defined-risk strategies. AI security tailwinds support bullish bias. Fed minutes tomorrow adds macro risk.

### CDNS (Cadence Design Systems)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Move** | ~3-4% (±$9-12 from ~$299 close) |
| **Historical Avg Move** | ~3-4% (in line with expectations) |
| **Put Premium (est.)** | ~$3.50-$4.50 for 30-delta puts 1 week out |
| **IV Rank** | Moderate |
| **Trade Grade** | **B** |

**Grade Notes**: Lower volatility = lower premiums, but more predictable. EDA duopoly provides stability. Better for income-focused traders than high-volatility seekers.

### MDT (Medtronic)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Status** | Already reported BMO - beat expectations |
| **Trade Grade** | **N/A** |

**Grade Notes**: Opportunity passed. Results were solid but stock already reacted.

### DVN (Devon Energy)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Move** | ~6-7% (commodity-dependent) |
| **Put Premium (est.)** | ~$0.80-$1.20 for 30-delta puts |
| **Trade Grade** | **C** |

**Grade Notes**: Below $50B threshold, commodity price dependence makes this macro trade vs company-specific play. Skip for earnings-focused strategy.

### RSG (Republic Services)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Move** | ~2-3% (low volatility utility-like) |
| **Put Premium (est.)** | ~$1.20-$1.80 for 30-delta puts |
| **Trade Grade** | **C-** |

**Grade Notes**: Low expected move, inconsistent revenue history, negative peer reactions (WCN -8.2%, WM -3.7%). Not attractive for earnings trading.

## Conclusion

**PANW is the most compelling earnings play today** due to:
1. **Highest expected move (9.04%)** - DOUBLE the 4.55% historical average
2. **Only stock meeting >8% expected move criteria** from today's earnings
3. Critical sector positioning (cybersecurity with AI tailwinds)
4. Recent acquisition activity (CyberArk $25B, Chronosphere, Koi) creating uncertainty/opportunity
5. Stock down 20% over past year, 9% YTD - potential for mean reversion
6. Strong analyst sentiment (46 total Buy/Strong Buy vs 15 Hold/Sell) with 34.8% upside to targets

**CDNS is secondary consideration** for more conservative traders seeking quality business with lower volatility (~3-4% expected move).

**MDT, DVN, and RSG less interesting**:
- **MDT**: Already reported with beat, lower volatility stock
- **DVN**: Too commodity-dependent for pure earnings trade, below $50B market cap
- **RSG**: Low expected move (~2-3%), inconsistent revenue history, negative peer reactions

## Next Steps for Bob:
1. **PANW deep dive**: Review options chain for specific strike selection, analyze IV crush potential
2. **Monitor guidance**: PANW's outlook on acquisition integration and AI security demand
3. **Risk management**: Consider defined-risk strategies (iron condors, butterflies) given 9.04% expected move
4. **Post-earnings analysis**: Review actual results vs. expectations and stock reaction for pattern recognition
5. **Watch FOMC Minutes**: Tomorrow's Fed minutes could create additional market volatility

## Key Risk Factors for Today:
1. **FOMC Minutes tomorrow** (Feb 18) - Could impact tech multiples and overall market sentiment
2. **PANW's double expected move** (9.04% vs 4.55% historical) suggests elevated uncertainty
3. **Software sector weakness** - Broader sector selloff could pressure PANW and CDNS regardless of results
4. **Acquisition integration risks** - PANW integrating multiple large acquisitions simultaneously

### PANW - Palo Alto Networks Inc.
**Current Price:** ~$166.00  
**Expected Move:** 9.04% (±$15.00)  
**Implied Range:** $151.00 - $181.00  

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Stock Price** | $166.00 |
| **Expected Move %** | 9.04% |
| **Expected Move $** | ±$15.00 |
| **Implied Range** | $151 - $181 |
| **Historical Avg Move** | 4.55% |
| **Move Premium** | 2.0x historical |

#### Put Selling Strategy
| Strike | Distance from Price | Est. Premium* | Annualized Return |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| $145 Put | -12.7% | ~$2.80-3.50 | ~85-105% |
| $150 Put | -9.6% | ~$3.80-4.50 | ~95-115% |
| $155 Put | -6.6% | ~$5.00-6.00 | ~120-140% |

*Estimated premiums based on 9% implied volatility expansion

#### Trade Grade: **A-**
**Rationale:** 
- ✅ Exceptional premium (9% expected move = 2x normal)
- ✅ Stock already down 20% YTD (mean reversion potential)
- ✅ Strong analyst support (27 Buy vs 1 Sell)
- ⚠️ Fed Minutes tomorrow adds macro risk
- ⚠️ Double historical move = elevated assignment risk

**Recommendation:** Sell cash-secured puts at $145-150 strike (10-12% below price) to capture IV crush while maintaining safety margin below expected move floor.

### CDNS - Cadence Design Systems Inc.
**Current Price:** ~$299.00  
**Expected Move:** ~3-4% (±$9-12)  
**Implied Range:** $287 - $311  

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Stock Price** | $299.00 |
| **Expected Move %** | 3-4% (estimated) |
| **Expected Move $** | ±$9-12 |
| **Implied Range** | $287 - $311 |
| **Historical Avg Move** | 3-5% |

| $285 Put | -4.7% | ~$3.50-4.00 | ~50-60% |

*Estimated premiums based on 3-4% expected move

#### Trade Grade: **B+**
**Rationale:** 
- ✅ Quality business (EDA duopoly with SNPS)
- ✅ Predictable earnings history
- ✅ Lower volatility = lower assignment risk
- ⚠️ Lower premium opportunity vs PANW
- ⚠️ Premium valuation (40x forward earnings)

**Recommendation:** Conservative play. Sell puts at $275-280 strike (6-8% below) for steady income with lower risk profile.

### MDT - Medtronic PLC
**Trade Grade:** N/A (Already Reported)  
**Status:** EARNINGS RELEASED BMO  
**Result:** Beat on revenue (+8.7%) and EPS  
**Action:** Skip - opportunity passed

---

### DVN - Devon Energy Corporation
**Trade Grade:** C  
**Recommendation:** Skip  
**Rationale:** Commodity exposure overrides earnings catalyst. Oil price risk dominates.

---

### RSG - Republic Services Inc.
**Trade Grade:** C-  
**Recommendation:** Skip  
**Rationale:** Low expected move (~2-3%), negative peer reactions (WCN -8.2%, WM -3.7%), history of revenue misses.

## Detailed Fundamental Analysis

### PANW - Palo Alto Networks Inc.

**Ticker:** PANW  
**Company:** Palo Alto Networks Inc.  
**Expected Move:** 9.04% (from options market pricing - TipRanks/Parameter.io)  
**Risk Level:** Medium-High  

**Key Findings:**
- **Earnings Context:** Reporting Q2 FY26 earnings after market close (AMC)
- **Market Cap:** $134.9B (well above $50B threshold)
- **Recent News:** Announced acquisition of Koi for Agentic Endpoint Security (Feb 2026); Completed $25B CyberArk acquisition; Closed Chronosphere acquisition
- **AI Security Threats:** Unit 42 2026 Global Incident Response Report shows AI accelerating attacks 4x over past year, boosting demand for cybersecurity
- **Stock Performance:** Down 9% YTD 2026, down 20% over past year, nearly 25% off October 2024 highs
- **Analyst Expectations:** EPS $0.94 (adjusted, +16% YoY), Revenue $2.58B (+14% YoY) - Visible Alpha consensus
- **Options Activity:** High options volume expected, with traders pricing in 9.04% move (DOUBLE the 4.55% average move of last 4 quarters)
- **Insider Activity:** Recent insider selling in January 2026 (Klarich Lee sold shares at $192-193)
- **Competitive Landscape:** Facing increased competition from Microsoft and CrowdStrike in cybersecurity space
- **Platform Strategy:** Pushing platformization deals (Strata, Prisma, Cortex) with CyberArk integration key focus

**Analyst Sentiment:** **Strongly Bullish** (27 Buy, 5 Hold, 1 Sell per Parameter.io). Average price target $225.06 (~34.8% upside from $167 close)

**Historical Accuracy:** **Excellent beat history but mixed stock reaction** - Beat earnings estimates in each of past 9 quarters, but stock has shown varied reactions. Last quarter (Q1 FY26) reported $0.891 EPS vs $0.93 expected (miss). Average move last 4 quarters: 4.55% (current expected move of 9.04% is DOUBLE historical average).

**Red Flags:** 
1. **Double the expected move** (9.04% vs 4.55% historical average) suggests heightened uncertainty/risk
2. Recent EPS miss last quarter (Q1 FY26)
3. High valuation at 83x forward earnings despite recent pullback
4. Integration risks from multiple acquisitions (CyberArk $25B, Chronosphere, Koi)
5. Broader software sector selloff pressuring multiples
6. **Fed timing risk:** FOMC Minutes release tomorrow (Feb 18) could create macro volatility
7. Insider selling in January 2026

**Recommendation:** **deep dive worth it** - High expected move (9.04%), critical sector positioning with AI security tailwinds, and potential for guidance update on acquisition integration. However, the DOUBLE historical expected move suggests elevated risk - consider defined-risk options strategies.

### CDNS - Cadence Design Systems Inc.

**Ticker:** CDNS  
**Company:** Cadence Design Systems Inc.  
**Expected Move:** ~3-4% (estimated based on historical patterns, lower than PANW)  
**Risk Level:** Medium  

**Key Findings:**
- **Earnings Context:** Reporting Q4 2025 earnings after market close (AMC)
- **Market Cap:** $81.5B (above $50B threshold)
- **Sector Position:** Leading EDA (Electronic Design Automation) software provider in duopoly with Synopsys
- **AI/ML Tailwinds:** Benefiting from semiconductor design complexity and AI chip design demand; recently launched Chiplet ecosystem for AI chip development
- **Analyst Expectations:** EPS $1.90 (non-GAAP, +1.1% YoY), Revenue $1.42-1.44B range
- **Guidance:** Q4 revenue guidance $1.405B-$1.435B, non-GAAP EPS $1.88-$1.94
- **Peer Performance:** Synopsys (SNPS) reported strong results recently, positive read-through for EDA sector
- **Stock Performance:** Down 2.5% over past month, down 10.47% over past year
- **Valuation:** Trading at ~40x forward earnings (77.3x P/E based on Simply Wall St), premium valuation
- **Recent News:** Stock rose 4.52% after launching new Chiplet ecosystem for AI chip development

**Analyst Sentiment:** **Bullish** - Average analyst price target $379.59 vs current ~$299 (26.8% upside potential)

**Historical Accuracy:** **Generally strong** - Company has history of meeting or beating expectations. Last quarter (Q3 2025) beat: $1.51 EPS vs $1.43 expected. Stock reaction typically muted for this steady performer.

**Red Flags:**
1. Slower growth rate (low single-digit EPS growth) compared to some software peers
2. Exposure to semiconductor cycle volatility
3. Valuation at premium multiples (40x forward earnings, 77x trailing P/E)
4. **Fed timing risk:** FOMC Minutes tomorrow could impact tech multiples
5. Short interest: 4.39M shares (1.61% of float) - not extreme but worth monitoring

**Recommendation:** **deep dive worth it for conservative traders** - Lower expected move than PANW (estimated 3-4% vs PANW's 9.04%) but more predictable business model and strong competitive position in EDA duopoly. Better for longer-term investors than high-volatility earnings traders.

## Conclusion

**PANW is the most compelling earnings play today** due to:
1. **Highest expected move (9.04%)** - DOUBLE the 4.55% historical average
2. Critical sector positioning (cybersecurity with AI tailwinds)
3. Recent acquisition activity (CyberArk $25B, Chronosphere, Koi) creating uncertainty/opportunity
4. Stock down 20% over past year, 9% YTD - potential for mean reversion
5. Strong analyst sentiment (27 Buy, 5 Hold, 1 Sell) with 34.8% upside to targets

**Trade Setup:** Sell $145-150 cash-secured puts for IV crush capture with 10-12% safety margin.

**CDNS is secondary consideration** for more conservative traders seeking quality business with lower volatility (~3-4% expected move).

**MDT, DVN, and RSG less interesting:**
- **MDT:** Already reported with beat, lower volatility stock
- **DVN:** Too commodity-dependent for pure earnings trade
- **RSG:** Low expected move (~2-3%), inconsistent revenue history, negative peer reactions

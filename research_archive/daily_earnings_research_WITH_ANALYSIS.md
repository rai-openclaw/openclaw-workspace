## Technical Analysis by Ticker

### PANW (Palo Alto Networks) — GRADE: B+

**Expected Move Analysis:**
- **Implied Move:** 9.04% (options market pricing)
- **Historical Avg:** 4.55% (last 4 quarters)
- **Multiple:** 1.99x historical (DOUBLE normal expectations)
- **Interpretation:** Market pricing in significant uncertainty — likely due to CyberArk integration, AI security demand updates, and guidance sensitivity

**Put Premium Analysis (Approximate, 1DTE):**
- **Stock Price:** ~$167
- **ATM Put (~$167):** ~$8.50 premium (estimated 28% IV)
- **Put Premium/Yield:** ~5.1% of stock price
- **IV Crush Potential:** HIGH — 28% IV likely compresses to ~18-20% post-earnings (35-40% crush)

**Strike Selection (Cash-Secured Puts):**
| Strike | Distance from Spot | Premium (Est.) | Yield | Delta |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|-------|-------|
| $160 | -4.2% | ~$6.50 | 4.1% | 0.40 |
| **$155** | **-7.2%** | **~$4.80** | **3.1%** | **0.30** |
| $150 | -10.2% | ~$3.20 | 2.1% | 0.22 |

**Recommendation:** $155 strike puts offer 7.2% cushion below spot while capturing meaningful premium. Double the historical expected move creates risk, but also opportunity for IV crush.

**Trade Grade: B+**
- ✅ 9%+ expected move (exceeds 8% threshold)
- ✅ High options liquidity
- ✅ Strong analyst bullishness (46 Buy/Strong Buy)
- ✅ Critical cybersecurity sector with AI tailwinds
- ⚠️ Double historical move = elevated risk
- ⚠️ Multiple acquisition integrations (CyberArk, Chronosphere, Koi)
- ⚠️ High valuation (83x forward P/E)

**Position Sizing:** Full position (if taking trade) — this is the best setup today
**Strategy:** Cash-secured puts at $155-160 strike, or iron condor for defined risk

---

### CDNS (Cadence Design Systems) — GRADE: C+

**Expected Move Analysis:**
- **Implied Move:** ~3.5% (estimated from historical patterns)
- **Historical Avg:** ~3-4% (typical for CDNS)
- **Multiple:** ~1.0x historical (market pricing normal expectations)
- **Interpretation:** Steady EDA business, low volatility, predictable results

**Put Premium Analysis (Approximate, 1DTE):**
- **Stock Price:** ~$299
- **ATM Put (~$300):** ~$4.20 premium (estimated 35% IV)
- **Put Premium/Yield:** ~1.4% of stock price
- **IV Crush Potential:** MODERATE — CDNS IV typically 35% → 28% post-earnings

**Strike Selection (Cash-Secured Puts):**
| Strike | Distance from Spot | Premium (Est.) | Yield | Delta |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|-------|-------|
| $290 | -3.0% | ~$3.00 | 1.0% | 0.35 |
| **$285** | **-4.7%** | **~$2.20** | **0.8%** | **0.28** |
| $280 | -6.4% | ~$1.50 | 0.5% | 0.22 |

**Recommendation:** Yields too low for meaningful income. Better as a long-term buy-write candidate than earnings trade.

**Trade Grade: C+**
- ✅ Strong competitive position (EDA duopoly with SNPS)
- ✅ Consistent earnings history
- ✅ AI chip design tailwinds
- ❌ Expected move below 8% threshold
- ❌ Low premium yields (<1%)
- ❌ Premium valuation (40x forward earnings)

**Position Sizing:** Skip or 1/4 position max
**Strategy:** Not recommended for earnings-specific trade; better for buy-and-hold with covered calls

---

### MDT (Medtronic) — GRADE: N/A

**Status:** Already reported BMO — beat on revenue ($9.017B vs est) and EPS ($1.36 vs $1.348 est)

**Recommendation:** SKIP — opportunity passed. Stock likely opening flat to slightly up.

---

### DVN (Devon Energy) — GRADE: C

**Expected Move Analysis:**
- **Implied Move:** ~6.5% (estimated, energy stocks volatile)
- **Historical Avg:** ~5-7% (typical for energy E&Ps)
- **Multiple:** ~1.0x historical
- **Interpretation:** Commodity-driven, not company-specific

**Put Premium Analysis (Approximate, 1DTE):**
- **Stock Price:** ~$36
- **ATM Put (~$36):** ~$0.85 premium (estimated 45% IV)
- **Put Premium/Yield:** ~2.4% of stock price
- **IV Crush Potential:** HIGH — energy IV typically 45% → 30% post-earnings

**Strike Selection (Cash-Secured Puts):**
| Strike | Distance from Spot | Premium (Est.) | Yield | Delta |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|-------|-------|
| $35 | -2.8% | ~$0.65 | 1.9% | 0.42 |
| **$34** | **-5.6%** | **~$0.45** | **1.3%** | **0.35** |
| $33 | -8.3% | ~$0.30 | 0.9% | 0.28 |

**Recommendation:** Skip — energy is a macro trade (oil prices, OPEC+) masquerading as an earnings play.

**Trade Grade: C**
- ✅ High IV = decent premium
- ❌ Below $50B market cap threshold
- ❌ Commodity price exposure (not company-specific)
- ❌ Earnings declining 30% YoY
- ❌ Variable dividend policy uncertainty

**Position Sizing:** SKIP
**Strategy:** Energy sector better traded via futures/ETFs than single-stock earnings

| $215 | -1.8% | ~$0.80 | 0.4% | 0.38 |

| $205 | -6.4% | ~$0.25 | 0.1% | 0.20 |

## Current Holdings

| Ticker | Company | Cost Basis | Current Price | Position Size | Thesis | Status |
|--------|---------|------------|---------------|---------------|--------|--------|
| RKT | Rocket Companies | ~$10 | $18.68 | Unknown | Refi boom play when rates fall + Trump Fed pressure | Up 87%, earnings Feb 26 |

## RKT Detailed Analysis (Updated Feb 13, 2026)

### Current Status
- **Entry:** ~$10 (timing not specified)
- **Current:** $18.68 (+87% gain)
- **Action:** Trim 40-50% before Feb 26 earnings
- **Hold:** 50-60% for 5-year platform thesis

### 5-Year Price Targets
| Scenario | Probability | Target | Annual Return |
|----------|-------------|--------|---------------|
| Bear | 25% | $12-16 | -4% to -8% |
| Realistic | 50% | $28-35 | +8% to +13% |
| Bull | 25% | $50-70 | +22% to +30% |

### Key Factors
- ✅ Trump Fed pressure (Warsh appointment likely)
- ✅ Potential refi boom 2026-2028
- ⚠️ Q-o-Q earnings still choppy (not META-style turnaround)
- ⚠️ At $18.68, paying 21x forward earnings (fair, not cheap)
- ❌ No clear moat yet (hoping platform thesis works)

### Trim Strategy
- **Sell 40-50%** at $18-19 = lock in $3.20-3.75/share profit
- **Hold remainder** with stop at $14 (below cost basis)
- **Reassess:** Post-Feb 26 earnings

### Next Catalyst
- **Feb 26, 2026:** Q4 2025 earnings
  - Watch: Production volume, servicing income, guidance
  - If EPS $0.25+ = trend turning, hold
  - If negative again = reconsider thesis

## LDI Detailed Analysis (Updated Feb 13, 2026)

### Current Status
- **Entry:** $2.65
- **Current:** ~$2.03 (-23% loss)
- **Position Size:** <1% of portfolio (fun money/speculative)
- **Action:** Hold as lotto ticket OR cut at $1.50 stop
- **Thesis:** Sharp turnaround if rates drop aggressively

### 2-Year Price Targets (Quick Turnaround Play)
| Scenario | Probability | Target | Return |
|----------|-------------|--------|--------|
| Bear (bankruptcy/dilution) | 40% | $1.00-1.50 | -43% to -62% |
| Realistic (survives, small profit) | 45% | $2.50-4.00 | -6% to +51% |
| Bull (refi boom, acquired) | 15% | $6-10 | +127% to +277% |

### Key Differences from RKT
- **77x smaller** market cap ($676M vs $52B)
- **Much riskier** — could go to zero
- **Higher upside** — 4-5x vs 2-3x if it works
- **Analysts say SELL** (vs Hold for RKT)
- **Still burning cash** (vs RKT was profitable in 2024)

### Risk Management (Given <1% Position)
Since this is "fun money":
- **Option 1:** Let it ride — can't hurt portfolio
- **Option 2:** Add on dips to $1.50-1.75 (average down)
- **Option 3:** Set hard stop at $1.50 (cut if thesis breaks)

### vs RKT Sizing
- **RKT:** 4% of portfolio = Core position, manage carefully
- **LDI:** <1% of portfolio = Speculative lotto ticket

### Recommendation
**Hold.** It's <1%, so the loss doesn't matter. But if it hits $4-5 on a refi boom, **sell 50-75%** immediately — don't get greedy with a distressed play.

### Next Catalyst
- Same as RKT: Trump Fed pressure, rate cuts
- Watch for: Breakeven quarter (first profitable quarter in 2+ years)
- If Q4 2025 or Q1 2026 shows profit = hold
- If losses continue widening = consider cutting
| NFLX | Netflix | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown | Track |
| NOW | ServiceNow | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown | Track |
| VSEQX | Vanguard Strategic Equity Fund | N/A | N/A | ~8-10% | Index/mid-cap exposure, margin collateral | Safe haven, market tracking |
| VTCLX | Vanguard Tax-Managed Capital Appreciation | N/A | N/A | ~8-10% | Large-cap, tax-efficient, margin collateral | Safe haven, market tracking |
| VTMSX | Vanguard Tax-Managed Small-Cap | N/A | N/A | ~5-7% | Small-cap, tax-efficient, margin collateral | Safe haven, market tracking |

## Index Fund Core Holdings (Vanguard Tax-Managed Trio)

### Combined Profile
- **Total Allocation:** ~25% of portfolio
- **Total Shares:** 5,868 VSEQX + 446 VTCLX + 2,514 VTMSX
- **Purpose:** Safe haven + margin collateral for put selling
- **Strategy:** Market tracking with tax efficiency

### Individual Fund Analysis

**VSEQX - Vanguard Strategic Equity Fund**
- Type: Active mid-cap blend
- Strategy: Multi-manager active approach
- Expense Ratio: ~0.25%
- **As Margin Collateral:** Moderate volatility, decent buying power

**VTCLX - Vanguard Tax-Managed Capital Appreciation**
- Type: Large-cap blend (tax-managed)
- Strategy: Minimize taxable distributions
- Expense Ratio: ~0.09%
- **As Margin Collateral:** Lower volatility, strong buying power
- **Tax Benefit:** Defers capital gains (important for your tax situation)

**VTMSX - Vanguard Tax-Managed Small-Cap**
- Type: Small-cap blend (tax-managed)
- Strategy: Minimize taxable distributions
- Expense Ratio: ~0.09%
- **As Margin Collateral:** Higher volatility, less efficient for margin
- **Tax Benefit:** Defers capital gains

### Margin Efficiency Assessment

| Fund | Volatility | Margin Efficiency | Put Selling Suitability |
|------|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| VTCLX | Low (large-cap) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent | Best collateral |
| VSEQX | Moderate (mid-cap) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Good | Good collateral |
| VTMSX | Higher (small-cap) | ⭐⭐⭐ Fair | Okay collateral |

### Why This Works for Put Selling

**✅ Advantages:**
- Diversified exposure (not single-stock risk)
- Tax-managed = less tax drag on your collateral
- Vanguard = low fees
- Market tracking = won't go to zero
- Marginable at Schwab

**⚠️ Considerations:**
- Small-cap (VTMSX) more volatile = margin requirements can fluctuate
- Active fund (VSEQX) has higher fees than index
- Tax-managed funds may have restrictions on frequent trading

### Alternative Consideration

**Would VTI (Total Stock Market) or VOO (S&P 500) be better?**
- Lower expense ratios (0.03% vs 0.09-0.25%)
- More liquid (ETF vs mutual fund)
- Similar margin treatment
- But you already own these and they work fine

**Verdict:** These are solid collateral. The tax-management is valuable for your situation. Consider if VTMSX (small-cap) is worth the extra volatility vs just holding more VTCLX.
| CRM | Salesforce | $182 | $189.72 | ~4% | AI disruption overblown, sticky enterprise moat | Recent buy, high conviction |

## CRM Detailed Analysis (Auto-saved Feb 13, 2026)

### Current Status
- **Entry:** $182
- **Current:** $189.72 (+4.2% gain)
- **Position Size:** ~4% (sizable chunk)
- **Action:** HOLD — high conviction based on domain expertise
- **Thesis:** AI disruption fear overblown, enterprise switching costs = millions

### Key Insights (From Rai's Implementation Experience)
- Salesforce migrations cost $2-10M+ and 12-24 months
- Enterprise F500 won't ditch millions in investment for AI pilots
- Switching costs create massive moat Wall Street underestimates
- AI disruption hits small companies first, not Salesforce's enterprise base

### 2-Year Price Targets
| Scenario | Probability | Target | Return |
|----------|-------------|--------|--------|
| Bear (AI disrupts) | 20% | $140-160 | -16% to -26% |
| Realistic (sticky moat wins) | 60% | $260-300 | +37% to +58% |
| Bull (AI transition succeeds) | 20% | $380-450 | +100% to +137% |

### Fundamentals
- Forward P/E: 15x (cheap for 20%+ EPS growth)
- EPS growth accelerating: +39% last quarter
- Analyst target: $320 (69% upside)
- Down 42% from highs = oversold

### vs Market Narrative
- **Market:** "AI will kill CRM"
- **Rai:** "Implementation costs = locked-in customers"
- **Edge:** Domain expertise from Oracle→Salesforce migrations

### Risk Management
- **Stop loss:** $160 (if AI thesis actually plays out)
- **Trim target:** $280-300 (take profits on moat re-rating)
- **Hold through:** Q-to-Q volatility, AI noise

### Next Catalyst
- **Feb 25, 2026:** Earnings (day before RKT)
- Watch: Agentforce adoption, revenue growth, margin expansion

## HOOD Detailed Analysis — PLATFORM THESIS (Updated Feb 13, 2026)

### Current Status
- **Entry:** $48.75 (700 shares)
- **Current:** $75.97 (+55.8% gain)
- **Position Size:** ~4-5% of portfolio
- **Peak Seen:** $120 (+146%) — didn't sell
- **Strategy:** Multi-bagger hold (2-5 year horizon)
- **Thesis:** Fintech platform transformation (not just crypto broker)

### Rai's Platform Thesis (High Conviction)
**The Market Sees:** Crypto broker (pumps with bitcoin)  
**The Reality:** Fintech platform (diversifying away from crypto)

**Evidence Supporting Thesis:**
- ✅ Record revenue in 2025 despite crypto -38%
- ✅ Options trading (highest margin) growing independent of crypto
- ✅ Prediction markets (elections, sports) = new revenue stream
- ✅ Net interest income rising with rates
- ✅ Credit card launch, lending, retirement accounts
- ✅ 24-hour trading, fractional shares, better UX than Schwab/Fidelity
- ✅ Innovation speed faster than incumbents

### Revenue Mix Shift
| Year | Crypto % | Platform % | Trend |
|------|----------|------------|-------|
| 2021 | 50%+ | 50% | Crypto dominant |
| 2023 | 35% | 65% | Diversifying |
| 2025 | ~25% | ~75% | Platform emerging |
| 2027 (Est) | <20% | >80% | Platform dominant |

### Multi-Bagger Potential (2-5 Year Targets)
**If platform thesis plays out:**

| Scenario | Price Target | Return from $48.75 | Timeline |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Bear** (crypto winter, platform fails) | $60-70 | +23-44% | 2 years |
| **Realistic** (platform recognized) | $150-180 | +208-269% | 2-3 years |
| **Bull** (fintech platform leader) | $250-350 | +413-618% | 3-5 years |

**Comparison to Rai's Past Winners:**
- TSLA: Early platform/tech disruption play
- NVDA: Early AI/data center play  
- PLTR: Early government/enterprise AI platform
- AMD: Early comeback/competitive moat play
- **HOOD:** Early fintech platform transformation

### Risk Tolerance Assessment
**Rai's Profile:**
- ✅ Can stomach volatility (beta 2.44)
- ✅ Multi-bagger hunter (200-600% targets)
- ✅ 2-5 year horizon (not trading, investing)
- ✅ Will add on dips (dollar-cost averaging)
- ✅ Domain expertise sees what market misses

**This fits HOOD perfectly:**
- High volatility = high reward potential
- Platform transformation = 3-5x if successful
- Early stage = market hasn't recognized value yet
- Innovation leader = competitive moat forming

### Action Plan (Multi-Bagger Strategy)

**HOLD Current Position:**
- 700 shares at $48.75 = core position
- Target: $150-250 (2-5 years)
- Don't trim on small gains

**ADD on Dips (If Thesis Intact):**
- **Buy zone:** $60-70 (20% dip from $76)
- **Aggressive add:** $50-55 (near cost basis)
- **Maximum add:** $40-45 (capitulation selling)
- **Stop adding:** Below $35 (thesis broken)

**Trim/Sell Triggers:**
- ❌ Platform thesis disproven (crypto still 50%+ of revenue in 2026)
- ❌ Regulatory shutdown of prediction markets
- ❌ Schwab/Fidelity catch up on innovation
- ❌ Massive security breach or fraud
- ✅ Take profits: $200+ (5x+ gain)

### Key Metrics to Watch
**Platform Health Indicators:**
- Non-crypto revenue % (want >75% by 2026)
- Prediction markets growth (quarterly)
- Options trading volume vs crypto volume
- Gold/subscription revenue growth
- Credit card adoption

**Red Flags:**
- Crypto revenue re-expanding to 40%+
- User growth stagnating
- Platform innovation slowing
- Competitors catching up

### Position Sizing Strategy
**Current:** ~4-5% (700 shares @ $48.75)
**Target max:** 8-10% (if conviction grows)
**Add scenario:** On 20%+ dips, add 200-300 shares
**Trim scenario:** Never trim until $200+ (5x+)

### Next Catalysts
1. **Q1 2026 Earnings (Apr 29):** Non-crypto revenue growth
2. **Prediction markets update:** Election betting volume
3. **Credit card metrics:** Adoption rates, spend volume
4. **International expansion:** UK, EU launches
5. **Platform narrative shift:** Analyst recognition

### Comparison to Past Winners
| Stock | Entry Price | Peak | Strategy | HOOD Parallel |
|-------|-------------|------|----------|---------------|
| **TSLA** | $30s | $400+ | Platform disruption | Fintech platform |
| **NVDA** | $50s | $900+ | AI/data center early | Platform shift early |
| **PLTR** | $10s | $80+ | Government AI platform | Retail platform |
| **AMD** | $10s | $160+ | Comeback/competitive | vs Schwab/Fidelity |
| **HOOD** | $48.75 | ??? | Platform transformation | Current opportunity |

### Bottom Line
**Rai's Strategy:** Find the moat early, ride volatility, 200-600% returns  
**HOOD Fits:** Platform transformation = potential 3-5x over 2-5 years  
**Conviction:** HIGH — market sees crypto, you see platform  
**Action:** HOLD, add on dips, don't trim until $200+

**This is a "swing for the fences" position that fits your TSLA/NVDA/PLTR playbook.**

## SOFI Detailed Analysis — DIGITAL BANK PLATFORM (Updated Feb 13, 2026)

### Current Status
- **Entry:** $12.63 (2,000 shares = $25,260)
- **Current:** $19.61 (+55.2% gain, +$13,960 unrealized)
- **Position Size:** ~3-4% of portfolio (Rai wants to increase to 6-8%)
- **Thesis:** Digital bank platform transformation (beyond student loans)
- **Conviction:** HIGH — just turned profitable, platform forming

### The Three Business Segments
**1. Lending (40% of revenue)**
- Personal loans, student loans, home loans
- Highest margins but rate-sensitive
- Growing originations despite high rates

**2. Technology Platform — Galileo (25%)**
- Banking-as-a-service for other fintechs
- **White-label infrastructure = SaaS revenue**
- Competitive moat, hard to replicate

**3. Financial Services (35%)**
- SoFi Money (checking/savings)
- SoFi Invest (brokerage)
- Credit cards, crypto trading, insurance
- **Cross-sell engine:** 40% of members use 3+ products

### Why This Fits Rai's Multi-Bagger Strategy
| Factor | SOFI | Why It Works |
|--------|------|--------------|
| **Platform Transformation** | Lending → Digital Bank | Like TSLA (cars → energy/AI) |
| **Just Turned Profitable** | 2024: First profit ($0.39 EPS) | Inflection point |
| **Rapid Growth** | EPS +120% YoY, +366% TTM | Operating leverage |
| **Member Growth** | 8M+ members, 1M+/quarter | Network effects |
| **Recurring Revenue** | Galileo SaaS + banking fees | High quality |
| **Competitive Moat** | Bank charter, tech platform | Hard to replicate |

### Quarterly Progression (Proof of Turnaround)
| Quarter | EPS | Trend |
|---------|-----|-------|
| Q3 2023 | -$0.29 | ❌ Losing |
| Q4 2023 | $0.04 | ⚠️ Breakeven |
| Q4 2024 | $0.31 | 🚀 Breakout |
| Q3 2025 | $0.11 (+120%) | 🔥 Accelerating |

**Real turnaround:** From -$0.29 to +$0.11 in 2 years. EPS growth accelerating.

### 2-5 Year Price Targets
| Scenario | Probability | Target | Return |
|----------|-------------|--------|--------|
| **Bear** (growth stalls) | 25% | $12-15 | -23% to -39% |
| **Realistic** (platform wins) | 55% | $30-40 | +53% to +104% |
| **Bull** (becomes THE digital bank) | 20% | $50-70 | +155% to +257% |

### BUY ZONE STRATEGY (Adding to Position)
**Current:** $19.61 — Want to add but waiting for dip

| Price Zone | Dip from Current | Action | Shares to Add | Total Position |
|------------|------------------|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **$17-18** | -10-15% | Light add | 500 shares | 2,500 (4-5%) |
| **$15-16** | -20-25% | Medium add | 1,000 shares | 3,000 (5-6%) |
| **$12-14** | -30-40% | Heavy add | 1,500 shares | 3,500 (6-7%) |
| **$10-11** | -45-50% | Back up truck | 2,000 shares | 4,000 (7-8%) |
| **Below $10** | -50%+ | STOP — thesis broken | — | Cut losses |

**Rai's Goal:** Build to 6-8% position (from current 3-4%)

### TRIM STRATEGY (Taking Profits)
**Don't trim until:**
- **$30-35** — Realistic target reached, trim 25-30%
- **$50+** — 3x+ gain achieved, trim 40-50%
- **$70+** — Home run territory, trim 60-70%, hold core

### Why SOFI vs HOOD Comparison
| Factor | SOFI | HOOD | Winner |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| **Profitability** | ✅ Profitable | ❌ Still losing | SOFI |
| **Volatility** | Beta 2.18 | Beta 2.44 | SOFI (less risky) |
| **Regulatory Moat** | Bank charter | No charter | SOFI |
| **Revenue Quality** | Recurring (SaaS) | Transactional | SOFI |
| **Upside Potential** | 3-5x | 3-5x | TIE |
| **Risk Level** | Medium-High | High | SOFI |

**SOFI is lower risk, similar upside = better risk-adjusted bet**

### Position Sizing Goal
**Current:** 2,000 shares (~3-4% of portfolio)  
**Target:** 3,500-4,000 shares (~6-8% of portfolio)  
**Method:** Add on 15-25% dips from current

### Bottom Line
**SOFI Grade: A- (Strong Conviction Multi-Bagger)**

**Rai's Strategy Match:**
- ✅ Platform transformation early
- ✅ Just turned profitable (inflection)
- ✅ Growing 50-100% annually
- ✅ 3-5x potential over 2-5 years
- ✅ Lower risk than HOOD, similar upside

**Action Plan:**
1. **HOLD** current 2,000 shares
2. **ADD** on dips: $17-18 (light), $15-16 (medium), $12-14 (heavy)
3. **Build to 6-8%** position over time
4. **DON'T TRIM** until $30+ (realistic target)

**This is another TSLA/NVDA-style platform play with lower risk than HOOD.**

## PFSI (PennyMac Financial Services)
**Analyzed:** February 13, 2026  
**Price at Analysis:** ~$92  
**Grade:** AVOID (Value Trap)

### Key Findings
- Q4 2025 earnings showed **76% collapse in servicing income** ($157M → $37M)
- Servicing business model broken when rates fall (MSR prepayments)
- Trading at 1.1x book value ($82.77 book vs $92 stock)
- P/E ~9x appears cheap but business is deteriorating
- Sold $24.4B MSR portfolio in Q4 (desperate move)

### Business Model Problem
- 60%+ revenue from servicing (recurring fees)
- Lower rates → homeowners refinance → loans pay off early → servicing revenue vanishes
- Cannot pivot quickly to production-heavy model like RKT
- Structural problem, not cyclical

### Verdict
**Value trap.** Cheap valuation doesn't compensate for business model deterioration. Avoid for long-term portfolio.

## RKT (Rocket Companies)
**Analyzed:** February 13, 2026  
**Price at Analysis:** $18.59  
**Rai's Cost Basis:** ~$10  
**Current Gain:** +86%  
**Grade:** B+ (Speculative Hold)

### Key Findings
- 70%+ revenue from production (origination fees) vs 30% servicing
- Benefits from lower rates (refi boom) unlike PFSI
- Up 86% from $10 buy point — easy money already made
- Earnings Feb 26, 2026 — high uncertainty event

### Bear Case (25% prob): $12-14 target
- Refi boom is "sell the news" — already priced in
- Servicing income could drop 50%+
- Margin compression from competition
- Opportunity cost if rates don't fall fast

### Realistic Case (50% prob): $20-24 target
- Moderate refi activity, 20% production growth
- Margins compress slightly but manageable
- 6-12 month timeline to target

### Bull Case (25% prob): $28-35 target
- Massive refi wave to 5.5-6% rates
- Production volume $140B+ (50% growth)
- Market share gains from struggling competitors
- AI/tech narrative drives multiple expansion

### Recommendation
Trim 30-50% before Feb 26 earnings or set stop at $16. Good position but not early anymore.

## LDI (loanDepot)
**Analyzed:** February 13, 2026  
**Price at Analysis:** ~$2.03  
**Rai's Cost Basis:** $2.65 (-23%)  
**Grade:** SPECULATIVE / LOTTO PLAY

### Key Findings
- **77x smaller than RKT** ($676M vs $52B market cap)
- **High risk, high reward** — could go to zero or 4-5x
- **40% bankruptcy risk** if rates don't cooperate
- **12.14% short interest** = squeeze potential
- **Analysts say SELL** — Wall Street hates it

### Business Model
- Pure mortgage originator (production-heavy)
- No servicing moat like PFSI
- Survives on volume, not recurring fees
- **Burning cash** — no profit in 2+ years

### Price Action Pattern
- $1.01 → $2.00 (steady, rate cut hopes)
- $2.00 → $5.05 (Trump election spike + short squeeze)
- $5.05 → $2.00 (4-month bleed, reality set in)
- $2.00 → $3.50 → $2.00 (Jan 2026 Trump hype fade)

### 2-Year Targets
| Scenario | Prob | Target | Return |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| Bear | 40% | $1.00-1.50 | -43% to -62% |
| Realistic | 45% | $2.50-4.00 | -6% to +51% |
| Bull | 15% | $6-10 | +127% to +277% |

### Strategy
- **<1% position** = fun money, can't hurt portfolio
- **Hold** for Trump/rates catalyst
- **Sell into spikes** at $3.50-4.00 (trim 50-75%)
- **Stop loss** at $1.50 (cut if thesis breaks)

### Active Monitoring
- **Cron job** checking every 30 min for spikes
- **Alert triggers:** >15% daily move, Trump/Fed news, earnings
- **Exit plan:** Trim on spikes, don't hold for $5 again

## Methodology Notes

- Factor in Trump Fed pressure for mortgage sector

## CRM (Salesforce)
**Analyzed:** February 13, 2026  
**Price at Analysis:** $189.72  
**Rai's Cost Basis:** $182 (+4.2%)  
**Position Size:** ~4% (sizable)  
**Grade:** A (High Conviction)

### Key Thesis
AI disruption fear overblown due to massive enterprise switching costs ($2-10M+ implementations).

### Why Rai Is Right (Domain Expertise)
- Oracle/SAP → Salesforce = millions in cost, 12-24 month projects
- Enterprise F500 locked in, won't migrate for AI pilots
- Salesforce's Data Cloud = proprietary data moat
- AI disruption hits small companies first, not enterprise base

### Fundamentals
- Forward P/E: 15x (cheap for 20%+ growth)
- EPS growth: +39% last quarter (accelerating)
- Revenue: $40.3B, growing 8%
- Dividend: $1.66 (0.9%), growing

### 2-Year Targets
| Scenario | Prob | Target | Return |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| Bear (AI disrupts) | 20% | $140-160 | -16% to -26% |
| Realistic (moat holds) | 60% | $260-300 | +37% to +58% |
| Bull (AI wins) | 20% | $380-450 | +100% to +137% |

### Action Plan
- **HOLD** 4% position — high conviction
- **Stop:** $160 (if wrong on AI)
- **Trim:** $280-300 (profit taking)
- **Earnings:** Feb 25, 2026

### Edge vs Market
Market fears AI disruption. Rai has implementation experience showing $millions in switching costs = sticky customers.

## HOOD (Robinhood) — PLATFORM THESIS
**Analyzed:** February 13, 2026  
**Price at Analysis:** $75.97  
**Rai's Cost Basis:** $48.75 (700 shares, +55.8%)  
**Position Size:** ~4-5%  
**Grade:** A (High Conviction Multi-Bagger)

### Core Thesis
**Market sees:** Crypto broker that pumps with bitcoin  
**Rai sees:** Fintech platform diversifying away from crypto dependency

### Platform Transformation Evidence
- Record revenue 2025 despite crypto revenue -38%
- Options trading (highest margin) growing independent of crypto
- Prediction markets (elections, sports) = new high-margin revenue
- Net interest income rising with rates
- Credit card, lending, retirement accounts expanding
- 24-hour trading, better UX than Schwab/Fidelity
- Innovation speed outpacing incumbents

### Revenue Diversification
| Year | Crypto % | Non-Crypto % |
|------|----------|--------------|
| 2021 | 50%+ | 50% |
| 2023 | 35% | 65% |
| 2025 | ~25% | ~75% |
| 2027 (Est) | <20% | >80% |

### Multi-Bagger Targets (2-5 Years)
| Scenario | Target | Return |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Bear (platform fails) | $60-70 | +23-44% |
| Realistic (platform recognized) | $150-180 | +208-269% |
| Bull (fintech leader) | $250-350 | +413-618% |

### Why This Fits Rai's Strategy
- Past winners: TSLA, NVDA, PLTR, AMD (all 200-600%+)
- Strategy: Find moat early, ride volatility, multi-year holds
- HOOD profile: Platform transformation = potential 3-5x
- Risk tolerance: Can stomach beta 2.44 for outsized returns

### Action Plan
- **HOLD** 700 shares (core position)
- **ADD** on dips: $60-70 (light), $50-55 (medium), $40-45 (heavy)
- **TRIM** only at $200+ (5x+ gain)
- **STOP ADDING** if thesis breaks (crypto >40% again)

### Comparison to Past Winners
| Stock | Entry | Strategy | HOOD Parallel |
|-------|-------|----------|---------------|
| TSLA | $30s | Platform disruption | Fintech platform |
| NVDA | $50s | AI early | Platform shift |
| PLTR | $10s | Gov AI platform | Retail platform |
| AMD | $10s | Comeback | vs Incumbents |
| **HOOD** | $48.75 | **Platform transformation** | **Current opportunity** |

## SOFI (SoFi Technologies) — DIGITAL BANK PLATFORM
**Analyzed:** February 13, 2026  
**Price at Analysis:** $19.61  
**Rai's Cost Basis:** $12.63 (2,000 shares, +55.2%)  
**Position Size:** ~3-4% (targeting 6-8%)  
**Grade:** A- (Strong Conviction Multi-Bagger)

### Core Thesis
Digital bank platform transformation: from student loan refi company to full-service fintech platform with SaaS banking infrastructure (Galileo).

### Three Business Segments
1. **Lending (40%):** Personal/student/home loans — highest margin, rate-sensitive
2. **Technology Platform/Galileo (25%):** Banking-as-a-service for other fintechs — SaaS revenue, competitive moat
3. **Financial Services (35%):** Checking, savings, investing, credit cards — cross-sell engine (40% use 3+ products)

### Platform Transformation Evidence
- Record revenue 2025 despite rate headwinds
- Just turned profitable (2024 first profit: $0.39 EPS)
- EPS growth: +120% YoY, +366% TTM (accelerating)
- 8M+ members, growing 1M+/quarter
- Bank charter = regulatory moat
- Recurring revenue from Galileo SaaS

### Multi-Bagger Targets (2-5 Years)
| Scenario | Target | Return |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Bear | $12-15 | -23% to -39% |
| Realistic | $30-40 | +53% to +104% |
| Bull | $50-70 | +155% to +257% |

### Buy Zone Strategy (Building Position)
Rai wants to increase from 3-4% to 6-8% position:
- **$17-18** (-10-15%): Light add (500 shares)
- **$15-16** (-20-25%): Medium add (1,000 shares)
- **$12-14** (-30-40%): Heavy add (1,500 shares)
- **$10-11** (-45-50%): Maximum add (2,000 shares)
- **Below $10**: Thesis broken, cut losses

### Trim Strategy
- **$30-35**: Trim 25-30%
- **$50+**: Trim 40-50%
- **$70+**: Trim 60-70%, hold core

### Why SOFI Fits Rai's Strategy
- Platform transformation early (like TSLA, NVDA plays)
- Just turned profitable = inflection point
- Growing 50-100% annually
- Lower risk than HOOD (already profitable, bank charter)
- Similar 3-5x upside potential

### Comparison to Past Winners
| Stock | Entry | Strategy | SOFI Parallel |
|-------|-------|----------|---------------|
| TSLA | $30s | Platform disruption | Digital bank platform |
| NVDA | $50s | AI early | Fintech infrastructure |
| PLTR | $10s | Gov AI platform | Banking platform |
| **SOFI** | $12.63 | **Digital bank transformation** | **Current opportunity** |

## PYPL (PayPal Holdings) — VALUE TRAP WATCH
**Analyzed:** February 13, 2026  
**Price at Analysis:** $40.29  
**Rai's Cost Basis:** $60 (1,100 shares, -33%)  
**Position Size:** ~2-3% (small, manageable)  
**Grade:** C+ (Low Conviction, Hold & Monitor)

### Core Problem
Former payments leader losing market share to Apple Pay, Square, Stripe. Innovation stalled, leadership in transition, cheap valuation (7.5x P/E) but potentially "cheap for a reason."

### The Value Trap Question
| Bull Case | Bear Case |
|-----------|-----------|
| 18% EPS growth, still profitable | Market share erosion |
| 7.5x P/E is absurdly cheap | Competition intensifying |
| New CEO could turn it around | No clear catalyst |
| Dividend (1.4%) while waiting | Declining business |

### Monitoring Plan
**HOLD for now:** Small position, not urgent, wait for signals

**Review Schedule:** Quarterly (May, Aug, Nov, Feb)

**Sell Triggers (3+ = exit):**
- Revenue growth turns negative
- Active users decline significantly
- New CEO fails to articulate strategy
- Market share accelerates decline
- Major customer defections

**Turnaround Signs (consider upgrading):**
- Clear strategy from new CEO
- Successful product launches
- Market share stabilizes
- Revenue growth reaccelerates

### Tax Consideration
- Unrealized loss: -$21,681
- Can harvest for tax benefit if decide to sell
- Opportunity cost of not redeploying to higher-conviction plays (SOFI, HOOD)

### Verdict
Not urgent to sell given small position size, but monitor closely. Quarterly reviews will determine if this becomes "cut losses" or "turnaround play."

## 5-Year Rate Trajectory Assumptions

### The Reality of Rate Cycles
- **2026:** 5.5-6.0% (Trump pressure, 2-3 cuts)
- **2027:** 4.5-5.5% (full refi boom)
- **2028-2029:** 5.0-6.0% (normalization)
- **2030-2031:** 6.0-7.0% (next hiking cycle begins)

**No one knows exact path, but we'll see at least ONE full refi cycle.**

## 🐻 BEAR CASE (5-Year) | 25% Probability
**Price Target: $12-16 (-16% to -36%)**
**Annual Return: -4% to -8%**

### What Happens:
- **Rates stay elevated 5-7%** for most of the period
- **Fed independence holds** — Trump can't force aggressive cuts
- **Inflation keeps popping** back to 3%+, blocking sustained cuts
- **Fintech competition intensifies** — Better.com, UWM, PFSI take share
- **Housing market stagnates** — no move-up buyers, no refis
- **RKT's AI/tech moat fails** to materialize

### The Numbers:
- Average EPS 2026-2031: $0.40
- P/E multiple: 15x (cyclical, no growth)
- Terminal value: $6.00
- **Plus dividends:** Assume 2% yield = $1.80 over 5 years
- **Total return:** $7.80 vs $18.68 today = **-58%** 🤮

### Why This Happens:
- 2020-2021 was the anomaly (COVID rates)
- "Normal" is 6-7% mortgage rates
- RKT can't earn consistent profits in that environment
- Stock fades to $10-12, trades sideways for years

- Survives competitors, buys market share
- Becomes fintech darling (AI narrative)
- Trades at 25x like tech stocks, not banks

## 📊 5-Year Summary Comparison

| Scenario | End Price | Total Return | Annualized | Key Assumption |
|----------|-----------|--------------|------------|----------------|
| **Bear** | $12-16 | -16% to -36% | -4% to -8% | Rates stay high, no moat |
| **Realistic** | $28-35 | +50% to +87% | +8% to +13% | One refi cycle, share gains |
| **Bull** | $50-70 | +168% to +275% | +22% to +30% | Two cycles, platform dominance |

**Probability-Weighted Expected Return:**
(0.25 × -25%) + (0.50 × +68%) + (0.25 × +220%) = **+58% over 5 years**
**= ~9.6% annualized**

## 🎯 The 5-Year Thesis: Is RKT a Platform or a Cyclical?

**The Critical Question:** Can RKT transition from "mortgage cyclical" to "fintech platform"?

**If Platform (Bull Case):**
- Recurring revenue from servicing
- Tech licensing to other lenders
- Cross-sell (Rocket Money, Auto, Insurance)
- Worth 20-25x earnings like SQ, PYPL

**If Cyclical (Bear/Realistic):**
- Lives and dies with refi waves
- No real moat
- Worth 10-15x earnings like banks
- $15-25 stock forever

**My View:** RKT is currently priced as **"cyclical with platform hopes"** — 18x forward earnings reflects optimism but not full platform valuation.

## 💡 5-Year Investment Decision Framework

**Hold/Add If You Believe:**
- ✅ Rates will normalize lower 2026-2028
- ✅ RKT can take share from struggling competitors
- ✅ AI/tech investments create lasting moat
- ✅ Housing market stays healthy (no crash)
- ✅ Management executes on diversification

**Trim/Exit If:**
- ❌ Rates stay 6%+ for 3+ years
- ❌ Competitors gain share
- ❌ Tech promises don't materialize
- ❌ Housing market crashes
- ❌ Better opportunities elsewhere (10%+ returns)

---

## 🏁 Bottom Line

**At $18.68 with 5-year horizon:**
- **Expected return:** ~10% annually (decent, not great)
- **Risk-adjusted:** Moderate risk (cyclical), moderate reward
- **Comparison:** SPY does 10% historically — is RKT better risk/reward?

**Your $10 entry was the smart money.** At $18.68, you're paying for hope.

**The 5-year play:** Trim some now (lock in 85% gain), hold core position for the platform thesis, reassess in 2027 after one full cycle.

**Does this 5-year view change your sizing decision?**

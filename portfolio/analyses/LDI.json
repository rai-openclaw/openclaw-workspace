  "full_content": "## LDI Detailed Analysis (Updated Feb 13, 2026)\n\n### Current Status\n- **Entry:** $2.65\n- **Current:** ~$2.03 (-23% loss)\n- **Position Size:** <1% of portfolio (fun money/speculative)\n- **Action:** Hold as lotto ticket OR cut at $1.50 stop\n- **Thesis:** Sharp turnaround if rates drop aggressively\n\n### 2-Year Price Targets (Quick Turnaround Play)\n| Scenario | Probability | Target | Return |\n|----------|-------------|--------|--------|\n| Bear (bankruptcy/dilution) | 40% | $1.00-1.50 | -43% to -62% |\n| Realistic (survives, small profit) | 45% | $2.50-4.00 | -6% to +51% |\n| Bull (refi boom, acquired) | 15% | $6-10 | +127% to +277% |\n\n### Key Differences from RKT\n- **77x smaller** market cap ($676M vs $52B)\n- **Much riskier** — could go to zero\n- **Higher upside** — 4-5x vs 2-3x if it works\n- **Analysts say SELL** (vs Hold for RKT)\n- **Still burning cash** (vs RKT was profitable in 2024)\n\n### Risk Management (Given <1% Position)\nSince this is \"fun money\":\n- **Option 1:** Let it ride — can't hurt portfolio\n- **Option 2:** Add on dips to $1.50-1.75 (average down)\n- **Option 3:** Set hard stop at $1.50 (cut if thesis breaks)\n\n### vs RKT Sizing\n- **RKT:** 4% of portfolio = Core position, manage carefully\n- **LDI:** <1% of portfolio = Speculative lotto ticket\n\n### Recommendation\n**Hold.** It's <1%, so the loss doesn't matter. But if it hits $4-5 on a refi boom, **sell 50-75%** immediately — don't get greedy with a distressed play.\n\n### Next Catalyst\n- Same as RKT: Trump Fed pressure, rate cuts\n- Watch for: Breakeven quarter (first profitable quarter in 2+ years)\n- If Q4 2025 or Q1 2026 shows profit = hold\n- If losses continue widening = consider cutting"

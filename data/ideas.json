  "description": "The corporate tab currently shows plain text instead of the intended visual tree structure. Alex investigated and found the CSS was accidentally placed inside a mobile-only media query. Need to: 1) Move CSS outside media query, 2) Test on both desktop and mobile, 3) Ensure tree visualization works with connecting lines and proper hierarchy.",

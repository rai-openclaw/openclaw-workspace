## 2026-02-17 - Earnings Screener & Docker Migration

### Earnings Screener Protocol v3.2 - FINALIZED
- **Weekly Setup:** Sunday image upload → Gemini OCR extraction → weekly_earnings_schedule.json
- **Daily Execution:** Mon-Fri 6:30 AM script run → Bob research → Kimi compilation → delivery
- **Sector Filters:** Exclude REITs, Utilities, Consumer Staples, Industrials, Basic Materials
- **Always-Include:** WMT, TSLA, NVDA, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META bypass filters
- **Delivery:** Email (primary) → Telegram fallback if email fails

### Gmail Configuration
- **Account:** thunderclapper34@gmail.com
- **App Password:** Working for IMAP (inbox check successful)
- **SMTP Status:** Still pending - authentication failing, troubleshooting tomorrow
- **Backup:** Telegram delivery confirmed working

### Weekly Earnings Data - Feb 16-20, 2026
Extracted from Earnings Whispers pinned tweet:
- Wednesday AMC: CVNA, DASH, EBAY, RELY (plus 5 gold miners excluded)
- Thursday BMO: WMT, LMND, W, NICE, VC, KLAR, DAVA
- Total filtered: 11 stocks for Wednesday report

### Today's Trades Logged
**SEP-IRA:**
- MCO: 2 puts ($370, $380 strikes) - $335 premium
- PANW: 15 puts across multiple strikes - $963 premium

**Robinhood:**
- PANW: 8 puts ($140, $138 strikes) - $412 premium

**Total Today:** $1,710 gross premium

### Docker Mission Control Migration - IN PROGRESS
- **Location:** ~/mission-control/
- **Status:** Container build running (downloading Python base image)
- **Files Created:** Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, requirements.txt
- **Migration:** server.py and templates copied from mission_control_prod/
- **Next Step:** Complete build and test container startup

### Key Decisions
1. Email delivery primary, Telegram fallback
2. Agent Bob handles research/grading, Kimi compiles final report
3. Docker Desktop for Mac (not CLI) for Mission Control
4. Detailed analysis for Grade A/B stocks, brief for C-F

### Tomorrow's Actions
1. Test email delivery with thunderclapper34@gmail.com
2. Complete Docker build verification
3. Run first live earnings screener report

## Agent Memory Architecture Discussion

### Current Problem Identified
- Kimi has MEMORY.md for persistent learning
- Bob and Alex spawn fresh each time - no memory persistence
- Alex appears to "do a bad job" because he can't learn from past mistakes
- No cross-agent knowledge sharing (Bob learns something, Alex can't use it)

### Proposed Solution: 3-Tier Corporate Memory

**Tier 1: Corporate Knowledge** (`memory/corporate-knowledge.md`)
- Company-wide decisions and protocols
- User preferences (trading style, communication)
- Cross-cutting insights (e.g., "PANW always has high IV")
- Lessons learned from failures

**Tier 2: Agent Expertise** (agent-specific files)
- `memory/bob-research-expertise.md` - Research patterns, grading calibration
- `memory/alex-coding-expertise.md` - Coding patterns, user style preferences
- `memory/dave-briefing-expertise.md` - Briefing formats, what works

**Tier 3: Project/Context Memory**
- Daily research outputs
- Project-specific notes
- Temporary working files

### Implementation Plan
1. Create corporate-knowledge.md with existing decisions
2. Create bob-research-expertise.md with grading insights
3. Create alex-coding-expertise.md with coding patterns
4. Update task prompts to include relevant memory files
5. Agents append learnings to their expertise files after each task

### Key Insight
Corporate structure only works if agents can learn and share knowledge. Individual isolated agents = inefficient. Shared corporate memory = emergent intelligence.

## Docker Build Status Update

**21:30 PST:** Build still in progress
- Downloading Python 3.11-slim base image
- Nginx test container running (confirms Docker works)
- Mission Control container not yet built
- Estimated completion: Tonight or early tomorrow morning

## Gmail SMTP Status

**Issue:** IMAP working (can check inbox), SMTP failing (can't send)
**Error:** 5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted
**Possible causes:**
- New account restrictions (despite being 3-4 years old)
- 2FA propagation delay
- Account flagged due to previous bot-like behavior
- Need manual "priming" (send one email via web interface first)

**Next step:** Try sending one email manually from gmail.com, then test SMTP again

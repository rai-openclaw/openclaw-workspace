## 6. Defensive Nature - Gold Standard for Put Selling?

**Why WMT is IDEAL for Put Selling:**

| Factor | WMT Rating |
|--------|------------|
| Beta (0.64) | EXCELLENT - Low volatility |
| Business Model | Recession-resistant (consumer staples) |
| Dividend | 0.70% yield, consistent |
| Market Position | #1 retailer globally, $1T market cap |
| Earnings Consistency | Very predictable |
| Balance Sheet | Strong (10.58B cash, manageable debt) |

**The "Gold Standard" Case:**
- Consumer staples sector = defensive
- People need groceries regardless of economic conditions
- Massive scale = pricing power
- Consistent cash flows support stock floor
- Lower implied volatility = more predictable option pricing

**Answer: YES** - WMT is among the safest names for put selling

---

## 7. Historical Premium vs Risk

**Premium Analysis:**
- Lower IV (implied volatility) compared to growth stocks
- Lower premium collection vs high-volatility names (NFLX, ROKU, etc.)
- **Trade-off:** Less premium BUT far lower assignment risk
- Win rate on OTM puts historically very high due to low volatility

**Expected Premium for 30-45 DTE, ~25-30 Delta:**
- Conservative strikes: 1.5-2.5% premium collected
- This is lower than tech/growth stocks BUT with dramatically lower risk

**Premium Justification:**
- If selling puts with 80%+ win rate vs 60% on volatile names
- Lower stress, less need for active management
- Suitable for larger position sizes due to safety
- Can trade more contracts with same capital due to lower risk

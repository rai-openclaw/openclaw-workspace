   - Expiration: Weekly (Feb 28)

AVOID LIST
==========

1. KLAR
   - Reason: Extreme risk - down 56% since IPO, 37.6% decline in 30 days, business model challenges, regulatory scrutiny. IV too high even for premium selling.

2. LMND
   - Reason: High binary risk as unprofitable insurer. Catastrophe losses unpredictable. Better to wait for profitability trajectory to improve.

3. EBAY
   - Reason: Too low volatility for meaningful options strategies. Better for stock ownership or covered calls than earnings plays.

SUMMARY
=======

February 18-19 earnings present mixed opportunities:
- WMT and NICE offer high-probability iron condor plays with their stable businesses and low expected moves
- CVNA and DASH provide high-volatility straddle opportunities given their elevated IV and binary outcomes
- KLAR should be avoided due to extreme risk profile
- Overall market expecting significant moves in growth names (CVNA, DASH, RELY) while established companies (WMT, NICE, EBAY) show stability

DETAILED ANALYSIS - TODAY AMC (FEBRUARY 18, 2026)
======================================================================

1. CVNA - CARVANA CO.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPONENT ANALYSIS:
• Volatility Score: 8/10 - Options imply 15.5% move vs historical 13.3% average
• Momentum Score: 6/10 - Stock up 45% YTD but down 8% past month
• Fundamental Score: 5/10 - High valuation at 2.5x P/S, improving margins
• Sentiment Score: 7/10 - 65% analyst buy ratings, short interest 12%
• Technical Score: 6/10 - Trading near 50-day MA, RSI 52 neutral

KEY INSIGHT:
Carvana's implied volatility is elevated due to binary outcome: either continued execution on path to profitability or disappointment from stretched valuation. Historical pattern shows 60% probability of >10% move post-earnings.

SPECIFIC TRADE SETUP:
Strangle: Buy Feb 21 $340 put ($8.50) and $360 call ($9.20). Total cost: $17.70. Breakevens: $322.30 or $377.70 (9.5% move). Target: 20% return if stock moves >15% ($21.24). Annualized return: 85%.

RISK FACTORS:
• Impact: High - Miss could drop stock 20-30%
• Probability: 40% - Valuation stretched, auto cycle concerns
• Mitigation: Position size 1% of portfolio, defined risk

BOTTOM LINE:
High-risk, high-reward earnings play with elevated volatility premium justifying option purchase.

• Sentiment Score: 3/10 - Only 45% analyst buy ratings, recent miss
• Technical Score: 4/10 - Bearish trend, support at $120

DoorDash faces perfect storm: food delivery growth slowing, grocery/retail expansion costly, and regulatory headwinds. Last quarter's miss (-20% vs estimates) suggests execution challenges.

SPECIFIC TRADE SETUP:

RISK FACTORS:
• Impact: Medium - Could rally on cost control improvements

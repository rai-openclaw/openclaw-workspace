## Usage Guidelines

### For Individual Agents

1. **Read relevant protocols** before starting work
2. **Check patterns** for reusable solutions
3. **Contribute** when you discover new patterns

### For Jarvis (Coordinator)

1. **Maintain protocols** - ensure they're current
2. **Archive old patterns** - move obsolete ones to archive/
3. **Write daily history** - summarize cross-agent activities

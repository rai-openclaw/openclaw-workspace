## 📝 Game Notes - Feb 14, 2026 (Ramparts)

**What He Did Well:**
- ✅ Scored 4-5 goals (dominated against rec competition)
- ✅ Responded well to halftime coaching (slowed down, scored 5 in second half)
- ✅ Good 1v1 moves and jukes to beat defenders
- ✅ High work rate chasing ball

**Areas to Improve:**
- ⚠️ **Positioning/Spacing** — chasing ball instead of finding open space
- ⚠️ **First touch/control** — first half touches too heavy, lost possession
- ⚠️ **Patience** — rushing shots instead of controlling then shooting
- ⚠️ **Defensive challenges** — hands up pushing opponent instead of focusing on ball first, using body to block

**Specific Moments to Review:**
- First half: heavy touches, missed shots due to rushing
- Second half: took coaching well, slowed down, finished better

**Coaching Focus for Next Practice:**
- **Positioning without ball** — finding open space instead of ball-chasing
- **First touch/control** — receiving passes cleanly
- **Patience in final third** — control, then shoot (not rush)

## 🏋️ Practice Drills & Homework

### Current Focus Areas (Feb 14, 2026)
1. **Positioning Without Ball** — Finding open space vs ball-chasing (biggest gap)
2. **First Touch/Control** — Softer touches to maintain possession
3. **Patience in Final Third** — Control, then shoot (don't rush)
4. **Defensive Body Positioning** — Focus on ball first, then use body to block (not hands/pushing opponent) 

### Drills to Try at Home

**Positioning/Spacing:**
- "Find the open cone" — Set up cones as defenders, practice finding open space between them
- "Shadow play" — Practice positioning while someone else has ball

**First Touch/Control:**
- Wall passes — Receive ball from wall, control with 1 touch, pass back
- Soft receiving — Have someone toss/pass ball, practice cushioning it (not bouncing off)

**Patience/Finishing:**
- 1v1 to goal — Beat defender, then control, then shoot (not immediately)
- "Pause then shoot" — Dribble, stop/pause, then shoot (builds habit)

**Defensive Body Positioning:**
- "Ball first, body second" — Practice shielding: get between opponent and ball using body/hips, not hands
- 1v1 defending — Focus on ball, use shoulder/hip to block, keep hands down

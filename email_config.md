## Manual Processing Note
Since automated Gmail polling requires additional setup, for now:
1. You email trades/docs to raito09726@gmail.com
2. I can check that inbox when you ask me to
3. Or you can forward confirmations directly in Telegram

## Future Enhancement
Once OpenClaw email plugin is configured, this will be fully automated.

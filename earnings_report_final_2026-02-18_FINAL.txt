• Assignment Desirability (15/20): Would own at $322-340 (5-10% discount). Online auto retailer with improving unit economics and path to profitability.
• Premium Yield (17/20): 15.5% EM = very high IV. ATM weekly strangle costing $17.70. Annualized 85% return on margin.
• Binary Risk (3/0): Valuation stretched at 2.5x P/S, auto cycle concerns, high short interest at 12%.

2. Binary outcome: continued execution vs valuation disappointment
3. High short interest adding to volatility

• Max Risk: Lose entire $17.70 premium if stock stays between $322.30-$377.70

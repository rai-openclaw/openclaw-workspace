## Notes

**Important Distinction:**
- **Realized P&L:** Closed positions (profit/loss booked)
- **Open Credit:** Premium received but still at risk until expiration or buyback
- **Unrealized Risk:** Can lose more than credit if stock drops below strike

**This Week's Focus:**
- Closed winners quickly (1 day hold)
- Rolled into safer names (WMT 100% ↓1.5x EM)
- Took risk on turnaround plays (CVNA, DASH) against analysis

**Next Week:**
- Monitor CVNA/DASH closely (high risk)
- Collect remaining open premium if positions expire worthless
- Assess if early close strategy is optimal
